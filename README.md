# Follow the instructions below to run the programme
1. Download the whole package as a .zip file (green button "code" in top right, then "Download Zip")
2. From the .zip file, extract the number2words.txt and num2words.ipynb to your Desktop
3. You can modify the input by modifying the number2words.txt file
4. A valid number is not separated by commas or dots, it must be an integer with no special characters 
   and it has at least one white space before and after. The input is valid if the string contans only one valid number.
5. Open the num2words.ipynb on a Jupiter notebook. Run the code and you will be asked to input the name of the .txt file that sits on your Desktop. 
   The name to input is "number2words" unless the user changed it manually after the download 
6. You will get an error with message "number invalid" in case the .txt file does not contain a valid number.
   In that case you can change the input string in the .txt file and run the programme again
